Security System

This project is a simple security system built using infrared and ultrasonic sensors to trigger an alarm (buzzer, LED, and LCD).

Features:
Clock System: Simulates time from 00:00 (midnight) to 23:00, advancing by 1 second to represent real-life hours.

Ultrasonic Sensor: Active between 9:00 AM and 8:00 PM. Triggers the alarm if an object is detected within 150 units.

Infrared Sensor: Active outside the 9:00 AMâ€“8:00 PM window (i.e., at night). Triggers the alarm when motion is detected.

Components Used:
- Ultrasonic Distance Sensor(4-pin)
- Infrared Motion Sensor
- Buzzer
- LEDs 
- LCD Display (16x2 I2C)
- 7 segment Clock Display
